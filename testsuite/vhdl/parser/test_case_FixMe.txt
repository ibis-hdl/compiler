ToDo:
- alias_declaration_00{1...5}
- entity_aspect/entity_aspect_002.input
- type_declaration_failure/*
- interface_constant_declaration/interface_constant_declaration_006.input
- type_conversion/type_conversion_001.input
- wait_statement/wait_statement_00x.input
- binding_indication/binding_indication_00{0,1}.input entity name rule (is work.foo -> name)
- allocator_003 (http://vhdl.renerta.com/source/vhd00004.htm) 
- component_configuration_000; configuration_declaration_000, reason 
  is related to rule name, where no selected_name is active!!!
- {block,generate_statement} test fails (and tests are missing) - problem is
  related to both rules! Seems related to concurrent_statement alternative
  rule, where concurrent_procedure_call_statement triggers exxpect ';' exception
  before can test component_instantiation_statement (also has ';')

Renewal 2018:
- Missing tests:
  - concurrent_procedure_call_statement
  - concurrent_signal_assignment_statement
