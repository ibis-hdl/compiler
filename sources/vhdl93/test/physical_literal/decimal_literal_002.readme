This is an interesting test; obviously the integer value equals implicit to
1 (one), even if the ast's integer part empty. To be investigated later.
Anyway, this results into an invalid tag.

input = 'ps'
result= '(physical_literal={l=(v:abstract_literal=(decimal_literal={l=, tag=INVALID})), u=ps})'
